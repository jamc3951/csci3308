Q: How does Bootstrapâ€™s Grid system work?
A: Bootstrap's grid system allows you to organize containers (or a single container) into square/rectangular spaces that are indicated via sets of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. You are limited to creating 12 columns however, but unlimited rows. The container acts as a wrapper to contain all of the content created by/in the intersections of the rows and columns.
